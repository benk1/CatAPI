# Cat API

This is an Application built with ReactJs where the you can fetch data from a given Api using Axios.
There are two cat API'S given, we use both to fetch data and one to get the image of a specific cat.
By clicking the name of the cat you can view more information or properties of a cat including the image of a cat.
